    "**Interprocess communication (IPC)**: A mechanism that allows for processes to send and receive data from one another. This mechanism follows two models **shared memory** where a portion of memory is allocated to be shared among processes that they all read and write to, and **message passing** where a message pathway is established among processes that holds messages in queue form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3.11 demonstrates both forms of IPC:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 3.11](./images/f3-11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Message passing is slower (due to them being built using system calls that occupy the kernel) but simpler (since no conflicts need to be avoided) and is thus useful for small amounts of data. Is also used for distributed systems where communication is done by multiple computers (with their own memory) connected by a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shared memory is more expensive and complicated but is faster since we can just implement routine memory reading for each process as the IPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method in which memory sharing works is using two types of buffers: \"The **unbounded buffer** places no practical limit on the size of the buffer. The consumer may have to wait for new items, but the producer can always produce new items. The **bounded buffer** assumes a fixed buffer size. In this case, the consumer must wait if the buffer is empty, and the producer must wait if the buffer is full.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the producer has a pointer to the last written point in the buffer and if it isnt full it writes to it (otherwise it waits for it to be empty. The consumer has a pointer to the last read point in the buffer, if the read pointer is equal to the write pointer it waits otherwise it reads from the buffer then increments the read pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In message passing we must establish a **communcation link** for processes to send and receive messages from, There are different implementation methods for the link:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direct communication (aka symmetry)**: Each process must reference which processes they are sending or reading info from (each processes pair has exactly one link):\n",
    "\n",
    "      send(P, message), receive(Q, message)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Asymmetry**: Only the message sender names the recipent, while the receiver doesnt have to name the sender\n",
    "  \n",
    "      send(P, message) — Send a message to process P.\n",
    "      receive(id, message) — Receiveamessagefromanyprocess.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Indirect communication**: messages are sent to and received from mailboxes, or ports. Processes can write to one or more mailboxes and read from one or more mailboxes\n",
    "\n",
    "    send(A, message) — Send a message to mailbox A.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    receive(A, message) — Receive a message from mailbox A.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Synchronization**: Message passing methods for communication between processes using send() and receive() functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blocking send**: The sending process is blocked until the message is received by the receiving process or by the mailbox.\n",
    "- **Nonblocking send**: The sending process sends the message and resumes operation.\n",
    "- **Blocking receive**: The receiver blocks until a message is available.\n",
    "- **Nonblocking receive**: The receiver retrieves either a valid message or a null.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Buffering**: A queue that holds messages being exchanged between two processes. The following possible buffering techniques are possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zero capacity**: The queue has a maximum length of zero; thus, the link cannot have any messages waiting in it. In this case, the sender must block until the recipient receives the message.\n",
    "- **Bounded capacity**: The queue has finite length n; thus, at most n messages can reside in it. If the queue is not full when a new message is sent, the message is placed in the queue (either the message is copied or a pointer to the message is kept), and the sender can continue execution without waiting. The link’s capacity is finite, however. If the link is full, the sender must block until space is available in the queue. \n",
    "- **Unbounded apacity**: The queue’s length is potentially infinite; thus, any number of messages can wait in it. The sender never blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipe**: One of the first IPC mechanisms in early UNIX systems. They act as a channel of communication for two processes. Two common types of pipes are ordinary pipes and named pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinary pipe**: Standard unidirectional communication system. The producer process writes to one end of the pipe known as the **write end** and the consumer process reads from the other side of the pipe known as the **read end**. If the pipes need two-way communication (they both need to read and write to each other) then we must open up two pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure 3.20 below demonstrates a pipe process \n",
    "(note that fd[0] is the read end of the pipe, and fd[1] is the write end \n",
    "\n",
    "and in this case the read end of the parent (fd_p[1]) is closed as its only writing and the write end of the child is closed (fd_c[0]) as its not writing)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 3.20](./images/f3-20.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Named pipe**: Also a unidirectional pipe (half-duplex transmission only). But now the pipe remains until its specifically deleted from the file system (acts as a file) and can be used by multiple processes (ordinary pipe deletes itself after its communicating processes have terminated). Follows a FIFO data structure with the possibilty of multiple processes as writers and multiple processes as readers. \"Additionally, the communicating processes must reside on the same machine. If intermachine communication is required, sockets must be used.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Socket**: An endpoint for communication, typically using some network service like SSH, FTP, and HTTP along with a port. These are used as a communication tool for a pair of processes communicating over a network (one socket is assigned to each process). Example connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Client process host X with IP address 146.86.5.20 initiates a request for a connection with a web server \n",
    "2. This web server is listening for connections on port 80\n",
    "3. The web server reads the clients request and returns a port number for it (greater than 1024) that turns out to be 1625\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the host and web server are able to exchange information specifically with each other by specifying each others ports as the destination. (Host sends data to port 80 and servers sends data to port 1625). This means that connections containing ports are unique, so if another process wanted to communicate with the web server it would need its own port value assigned (something greater than 1024 and not equal to 1625).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is demonstrated visually in figure 3.26 below:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Local-area network (LAN)**: Nodes are distributed over a small geographical area like inside a single building or a number of adjacent buildings. One of the main advantages of LAN over WAN is that due to each node/computers short distance the connection/communications links usually have a higher speed and lower error rate. Connection links are usually either WIFI or an ethernet cable.\n",

Connection links are usually telephone lines, leased (dedicated data) lines, optical cable, microwave links, radio waves, and satellite channels. The communication links are controlled by **routers** that are responsible for directing traffic to other routers and networks but also the general information transfer through the links to the nodes. Figure 19.3 below demonstrates a distributed system with network hosts (nodes) on the outside and routers on the inside:\n",

    "Even though WAN's are generally slower than LAN's, WAN's connections that link major cities may have very fast transfer rates through fiber optic cables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)**: A communication standard link that is used by the internet for its distributed system. It transmits data (back and forth) between a client and a server by first establishing a connection and then using that connection to share data by breaking it down into smaller packets and piecing them back together on the other side. It can be broken down into 4 layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Application layer - Interactive layer for the user, handles data exchange on the application. An example is http on a website\n",
    "2. Transport layer - Handles the data preperation, splits the data into TCP/UDP packets and places them inside a packet order and controlling flow. (Kinda like the packaging center for a mailroom)\n",
    "3. Internet layer - Encodes and decodes routing IP values onto the data packets. (Kinda like the mailroom person adding mailing stamps and reading mailing stamps)\n",
    "4. Link layer - Handles the transmission of data over a physical medium (handling error detection and data recovery). (Kinda like the mailtruck driving the mail).\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP is a reliable connection-oriented transport protocol (compared to UDP). TCP implements a byte stream that allows for data to be sent in order and uninterrupted. It does so with the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Establishes a **acknowledgment packet (ACK)** which is a required message that the receiver has to send to the sender to acknowledge that they received the data from the sender.\n",
    "2. Utilizes **sequence numbers** which act as unique id's and increase incrementally with each data packet so the sender can make sure its receiving the data in order.\n",
    "3. Uses control packets to initialize a connection and to tear down a connection. Known as a **three-way handshake** as the following 3 signals are exchanged: SYN, SYN+ACK, ACK.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 19.11 demonstrates an example of a TCP data transfer. The example can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After a connection is established, the client sends a request packet to the server with the sequence number 904.\n",
    "2. The server sends back an ACK for the data 904 request.\n",
    "3. The server then sends its own data to the client identifiable with the sequence number 126.\n",
    "4. The client receives data 126 and sends back an ACK for it.\n",
    "5. The server then tries to send data with sequence number 127 to the client, but the data does not reach and gets lost.\n",
    "6. The server reached its time limit waiting for an ACK for data 127 and so it reaches a timeout and resends data 127.\n",
    "7. This time the client receives data 127 and sends an ACK for it to the server.\n",
    "8. The server sends the next piece of data to the client (with sequence number 128).\n",
    "9. The client receives the data and sends back an ACK for it but the ACK is now lost and never delivers.\n",
    "10. The server reaches its timeout for the ACK for data 128 and resends data 128.\n",
    "11. The client receives data 128 again, marks it as a duplicate and resends the ACK for it (knowing that its previous ACK must have not been delivered).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 19.11](./images/f19-11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flow control**: Mechanism utilized by TCP to regulate the flow of data packets. Prevents the sender from overrunning the capacity of the receiver. It does this by encoding a message in ACK's that tell the sender to either slow down their data sending or to speed it up (and this is determined by many factors including the receivers hardware and the current speed of the network).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Congestion control**: Determines the slow down or speed up message in ACK from flow control by analyzing how many data packets are being lost/dropped (as router drops data packets if overwhelmed by requests).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access control (MAC) address**: The address attached to a datapacket that is being sent within a local network (LAN). Every Ethernet/WiFi device has a unique medium access control (MAC) address. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Address resolution protocol (ARP)**: The address generated for a data packet that is being sent from a system on a local network to another system on a different local network. Also known as: IP to MAC address mapping. In this mapping of ARP to IP we can then send packets of data that have a certain ARP which is mapped to certain MAC addresses so we can send data to only a certain amount of specific local networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: A bare bones quick and cheap version of TCP. The UDP header only contains four fields: source port number, destination port number, length, and checksum. Packets of data sent quickly but with no guardrails meaning we can lose some data packets in the process (or get them out of order) and its up to the application to handle this by either requesting the missing packet again or deciding to make do with whatever packets it did receive. Also known as a **connectionless** protocol as there is no connection setup to establish a communication state between the servers nor is there a connection teardown, UDP simply sends the data right away and hopes that the recipient is able to receive it."
